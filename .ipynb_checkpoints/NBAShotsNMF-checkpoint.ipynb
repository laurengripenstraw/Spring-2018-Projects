When the weights of attributes are similar among two players, that could indicate that they play the same position. If I was able to examine the entire matrix, I would almost certainly find groupings of players that had similar weights for the same attributes. In addition, with regards to correlation matrix R, players that are highly correlated would likely play the same position, and different levels of correlation could indicate different positions in relation to each other and what space they occupy on the court. The majority of entries in the correlation matrix fall somewhere in the middle, which makes sense, because there is some correlation among different positions, but there is not an abundance of players who play the same position in this data. Also, I would expect results similar to the linked page because my results do not show only 5 distinct groupings of players, but a spectrum that could be classified into more than 5 positions."

    "I would use this information to classify players into positions, and possibly to recognize skills that could place them in a different position than they have previously played to help them play better. Also, it would be useful to know if players fall into a sort of combination category in the case of having to fill a space of an injured player. I did not know a lot about basketball previously, and now I know that shooting pattern is a large factor in determining a player's position. A further question I would ask using basketball data and shooting patterns is whether a player is more likely to get injured if their shooting pattern falls in a particular area of the court. This could also help coaches by allowing them to put valuable players who as determined by this data could fall into an in-between position into a position where they are less at-risk."
