Here, we convert all text to lower case, remove punctuation, numbers, and stopwords, stem words, and remove extra whitespace. The benefits to each process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lower case:** Converting all text to lower case ensures that words with different capitalizations are not counted differently. For example, we do not want \"Text\" and \"text\" to be counted as different words as this can significantly alter results. Perhaps this process is not desired if one wishes to understand what people start their sentences with, but that is not the aim of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remove Punctuation:** Again, this further renders our data uniform. It is also possible that failing to remove punctuation could count \"text-mining,\" \"text mining\", and \"text mining.\" differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remove Numbers:** Although extracting numbers in a review may uncover certain information, they are difficult to work with and would most likely have very little impact on our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remove Stop Words:** Stop words are words with very little predictive value. These often clutter the dataset without providing any insight. An added benefit is that working with the dataset after removing these words is more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stem Words:** Words of various conjugations and forms have the same meaning for our purposes so we do not want them to be counted separately. For example, \"visit,\" \"visited,\" and \"visitor\" all convey the same general meaning and thus we would like them grouped together. This method may backfire for certain words, but it generally improves results overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stripping White Space:** After performing these pre-processing operations, we are left with many empty spaces which make the data difficult to read. Stripping unnecessary whitespace remedies this issue and makes our data more coherent."

    "Finally, we used sentiment analysis to understand how Yelp reviewers felt in their experiences. A quick look at the dataset shows that most reviews were positive, but we wanted a more in-depth understanding as well.\n",

    "The first thing we did was plot the sentiment of each review. This was not extremely useful for our purposes but could have been for identifying trends over time if our reviews came with a time-stamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then studied the binary and directional sentiments of each review through four different sentiment analysis dictionary. Each dictionary defines different words with a certain positivity or negativity scores, which the model aggregates. Using a binary response gives a score of \"positive\" or \"negative\" for each review and a directional response gives a score of \"positive,\" \"neutral,\" or \"negative.\"\n",

    "We then output the results of our analysis in CSV files. Each file contains the review number, the number of words in the review which were referenced by all dictionaries, and the label each dictionary provided the review. As a result we are left with four scores for each review. In Excel, we assigned values as such: positive = 1, neutral = 0, negative = -1 and averaged these scores to arrive at an ultimate \"average sentiment.\"\n",
